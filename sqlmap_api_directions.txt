Hi guys, firstly I would like to thank you for using Zeus, it's pretty cool right?!

Now that we got out of the way, I recently came across a video of someone trying to
show people how to use Zeus and receiving an error while trying to use sqlmap's API
server : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nADNliYrnuI

If you watch that video you will see that they never started the sqlmap API, nor passed
any of the correct flags to even attempt to auto start it. They simply thought that
Zeus would automatically find sqlmapapi.py and just start it for them. Well, yes that
is possible, but it has not been implemented yet. In order to use sqlmap with Zeus you
will need to do one of two things:

A) (easiest way) CD into sqlmap and run `python sqlmapapi.py -s`
B) Pass the correct flags in order for Zeus to attempt to find sqlmap on your system
   and attempt to auto start the API server.

Also please keep in mind that for now, you will need to restart the API server every
iteration. I've been trying to figure out a way to extract the hash ID values into a
unique list, but it's a lot harder then you think it is. So remember to start the API
and then press enter at the prompt. If you read the output (which you probably don't)
then you will see that it tells you to start the API before continuing. I have caught
the error and it will output that the API is not started if it hits that error. Once
again, thank you for using Zeus, hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy creating it.
